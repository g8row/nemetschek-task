# nemetschek-task
this is the repository for code for my application to the [Nemetschek SpeedItUp](https://careers.nemetschek.bg/speeditup/junior) project. I decided to work on my project with GIT, as to show my dedication and interest in the tech world.

feel free to check out my other recently opened project, where i learn to use git, http requests with a RESTapi, and java swing.
