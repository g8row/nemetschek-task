Hello,

as an attempt to show how serious i am about my path to becoming a programmer,
I have worked on this project with git on Github.In recent days I have started using GIT, 
so naturally i wanted to show off. Please visit my repository of the solution for this task.

On my profile I also have another project, as i have recently started to build my portfolio, so 
you can also visit it, it's not done in the slightest, but it shows my recent progress.

Alexander
